## 📖 How I’m Learning Java
I am learning Java using:
- Online tutorials and documentation (e.g., [Oracle's Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)).
- Books like *"Introduction to Programming using Java"*
- Practice problems from coding platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) or [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).
- YouTube tutorials and community resources.
